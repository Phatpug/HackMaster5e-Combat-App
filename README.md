# HackMaster5e-Combat-App
A python app to help players make combat decisions

Hi, first off this will be my first python app, so this is a learning excersize for myself.  Please be kind with your comments.

App Goals:
1.  Easy to use GUI to provide information about combat manuvers.
2.  Add player input, such as selecting available weapons, armor, specializations, etc to allow app to calculate att, damage, and effects of subsequent combat manuvers.
